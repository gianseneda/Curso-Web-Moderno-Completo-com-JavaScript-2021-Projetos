168
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:07,879
Keep doing the song
while I work the scene.

169
00:05:07,915 --> 00:05:08,915
You got it!

170

[sings melody
to Hall & Oates' "Maneater"]

171
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:10,991
Okay, bullet lodged there

172
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:12,685
is 4 feet below the hole in the backdrop

173
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:14,956
indicating a trajectory
of about 15 degrees,

174
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:16,080
which means the shot was taken

175
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:17,604
from either the second or third floor

176
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:18,822

I thought I stationed you...

00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:33,598
not here!

187
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:34,548
Right.

188
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,715
I'm just here in the plaza

189
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,162
looking for, um...

190
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:38,907
this!

191
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,670
A half-eaten box of McNuggets?

192
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:42,106
- Yup, it's my lunch.
- Uh-huh.

193
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,950
And what type of food is a McNugget?

194
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:46,759
Some type of a... paella?

195
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:48,555
You had to know that was a bad guess.

196
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:50,593
Well, the point is, I needed my paella

197
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:51,773
and I noticed the sky bridge,

198
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,161
so I thought I might be of some help,

199
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:54,684
but I'll just go back

200
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,251
and stand next to a piece of police tape

201
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:57,662
and do nothing.

202
00:05:58,296 --> 00:05:59,602
Wait, stop.

203
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:00,821
How would you like to stick around

204
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:02,071
and assist on the case?

205
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:03,100
You sure, Jake, I mean,

206
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:04,616
there's only room for one Manhunter.

207
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:05,926
Boyle is right,
I don't want to overstep.

208
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:07,154
You're not overstepping.

209
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,229
I mean, he interrupted
the song, but whatever.

210
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:09,846
Great, I'll just leave my paella

211
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,094
on the ground, save it for later.

212
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,783
We all know that's not your lunch!

213
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:16,111
So, the shooter was standing right here.

214
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:17,844
A standard long gun
would've ejected the casing

215
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,978
right over...

216
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:21,065
there, where Holt
is already putting down

217
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:22,151
an evidence marker.

218
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:23,797
Yes, I found it quite quickly.

219
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,800
Great, thank you for saving
me the trouble of doing my job.

220
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:27,272
Oh, sorry.

221
00:06:27,308 --> 00:06:29,291
Would you like me to pick
the evidence marker back up

222
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:30,590
so you can place it on the ground?

223
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,113
- Yes!
- No, of course not.

224
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:33,156
Good work.

225
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,890
BOTH: I bet the shooter went that way.

226
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:37,190
- Sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

227
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,397
BOTH: Follow me to the service entrance.

228
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,870
Ugh, we did it again. I'm so sorry.

229
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:43,690
- It's really no problem.
- Great!

230
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:44,733
Follow me, everyone!

231
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:45,769
Wait, what?

232
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:48,303
Security footage showed
no cars leaving the area,

233
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:50,000
so our shooter
must've left here on foot.

234
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:51,219
He's taking over your case, Jake.

235
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:52,612
You have to stop him.

236
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:54,265
Well, you know, it takes a true leader

237
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:55,702
to let someone else lead.

238
00:06:55,745 --> 00:06:57,980
Ugh, sounds exactly
like something I would say.

239
00:06:58,016 --> 00:06:59,235
Snap out of it.

240
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,229
Look, it's fine, I just...

241
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:01,838
I feel sorry for him, okay?

242
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:03,623
His assignment was
standing next to tape.

243
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,754
I'm still gonna crack the case.

244
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:06,103
- I cracked the case.
- Come on!

245
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:08,236
Hot dog man, tell them what you told me.

246
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,194
I saw a guy, mid-height, brown hair,

247
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:12,066
and a green hoodie with an owl on it.

248
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:13,589
He had a big bag
and he was running like hell.

249
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,631
It sounds like our guy.

250
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,461
All right, let's call it in to
give a statement to the press.

251
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:17,524
Great idea.

252
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:21,553
He knows that I meant I would
give the statement, right?

253
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:22,859
And if the shooter's watching,

254
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:24,252
I hope you like living

255
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:27,777
between St. Charles Place
and Connecticut Avenue.

256
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:29,823
Because that's where jail is
in "Monopoly."

257
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,695
A great line from a great man,
or should I say,

258
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:33,957
Manhunter.

259
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:35,655
Yeah, he overstepped.

260
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,173
- _
- Boyle, gather everyone up.

261
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:41,305
Oh, we starting a burn book about Holt?

262
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,306
Let's drag him, baby!

263
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,873
No, someone saw our hoodie guy.

264
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,222
Right, we'll do the burn book later.

265
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,955
Attention, everyone,
we have a possible sighting

266
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:48,297
of our shooter on Hoyt Street.

267
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,972
Detective Boyle and I
will take Alpha unit.

268
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,463
- Smith, Fox...
- You guard the burn book.

269
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:52,601
- Charles, no.
- Stand down.

270
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:53,795
You take Bravo unit.

271
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:55,434
The rest of you,
continue to sweep the area

272
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,732
in case this lead doesn't pan out.

273
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,299
The clock is ticking, go, go, go!

274
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:00,518
Where should I go, Detective?
I'd love to be of service.

275
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:02,825
Captain Holt! I mean... dude!

276
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:04,566
I haven't seen you since
your big news conference

277
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,715
which I just loved.

278
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,751
Ray, there you are!

279
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,316
I can't believe
you left your post again.

280
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:11,319
Detectives, I'm sorry for
my partner's bad boy behavior.

281
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:12,893
I am not a bad boy,

282
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:14,757
I'm trying to catch bad boys!

283
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,664
If anything, I'm a good boy.

284
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,702
That's exactly what a bad boy would say.

285
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:20,784
It's definitely not,
and no need to apologize,

286
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,811
we have a job to do.

287
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:23,014
Great! Where do you want us?

288
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,385
Someone matching our shooter's profile

289
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,247
was just seen over on Atlantic and 4th,

290
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:27,937
I need you both there
immediately, can you handle it?

291
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:28,968
Absolutely not,

292
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:30,418
it sounds like
way too much responsibility.

293
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,072
Don't listen to Debbie. We're on it!

294
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:33,485
All right. Bye!

295
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:35,349
What's going on?
The guy's on Hoyt Street.

296
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:37,488
I know, I gave Holt
a fake lead to get rid of him.

297
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:39,178
Don't worry, I'm still...

298
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:40,258

- Okay, good news.

308
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:54,616
I found a bodega in the containment zone

309
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,965
and got a bunch of pregnancy tests.

310

- A bunch?
- Yeah.

311

It's a New York bodega,
you can't be too cautious.

312
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,273
Good point. Yep, expired ten years ago.

313
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:02,353
Open. And used!

314
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:03,738
Made of gummies? Why?

315
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,036
Weirdly vibrating.

316
00:09:05,072 --> 00:09:06,541
This is for teens. That's dark.

317
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,030
This is good.

318
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,535
Great, let's do this.

319
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:11,530
Hey, Santiago,
nice work at checkpoint one.

320
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:13,461
Wait, why are you guys
being all weird again?

Is everybody talking about me now?

484
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,889
- Nobody is talking about you.
- Sure.

485
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,804
Terry walks into a tent

486

and everybody just happens
to stop talking

487

You are gaslighting me
just like my daughters!

489
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:09,466
Terry, I think you're being paranoid.

490
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:10,677
I'm not paranoid!

491
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,146
I put a recording device
in my girls' room.

492

in your daughters' room?

But they were laughing like it was,

I know we got kicked off the case,

501
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,444
but there is good news.

502
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,787
I unlocked a new accessory
for my Foot Friend avatar:

503
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:36,799

Debbie, wait. Change of plans.

We're not going back to the precinct.

506
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,756
Are we gonna go rogue and pick up cones?

507
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,725
Oh, we're going way more
rogue than picking up cones.

508
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,415
Listen, it's unlikely our shooter

509
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,014
had his own hot dog cart...
where'd he get it from?

510
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,276
Please don't make me help you with this.

511
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:51,140
My guess is the food cart garage

512
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:53,091
just two blocks away
from our crime scene,

513
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:56,304
or, shall I say, 238 steps.

514

Don't tempt me with steps.

This is a defining moment for you.

516

You can either obey orders
for the rest of your life

517
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,374
and make no impact
on the world, or stand up!

518
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,359
And solve this case with me.

519
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:11,945
Is there a third option?

520
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:13,287
- Nervously tag along.
- Great.

521
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:15,608
I choose the nervously tag along option.

522
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,752
Okay, the reporters are all
set for your press conference.

523
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:20,328
It's your big moment, are you excited?

524
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:21,725
- No.
- Oh.

525
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:23,067
Are you worried
about your voice cracking?

526
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:24,409
Do you want me to help you
warm up your throat?

527
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:25,664
- What would that entail?
- I'll just show you.

528
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Don't show me, tell me.

529
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:28,259
I blow hot air into my hands
and I stroke your neck.

530
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,688
That's not gonna happen,
and it's not why I'm stressed.

531
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:31,395
I think Holt got into my head.

532
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,998
We might have to delay
the press conference.

533
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:34,387
But this is the moment
we've been waiting for.

534
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:35,856
My dad's driving home early

535
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,505
from his brother's funeral
to watch it live.

Wait, he's doing what?

If you want me to put it
in a better context, I can't.

This was very important to him.

539
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:43,865
Holt is a great cop,

540
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:45,518
and I know the demotion's
driving him crazy,

541

but his gut is usually right.

542
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:48,970
I think we need to find
that hot dog cart guy.

543
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:50,094
Okay, fine.
