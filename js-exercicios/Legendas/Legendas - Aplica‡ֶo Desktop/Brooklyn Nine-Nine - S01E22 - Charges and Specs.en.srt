1
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:08,086
I didn't wash my hands, and I don't care.

2
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:09,852
Yup.

3
00:00:09,853 --> 00:00:13,833
Cool to be some place
right when things get good, right?

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,731
Another pitcher of
your strongest beer, please, good sir,

5
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:21,423
and a glass thingie to drink it out of.

6
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:25,745
And one of whatever
this guy's having for that guy,

7
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:28,268
and one of what
that guy's having for this guy.

8
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:31,018
And another round for everyone, on me!

9
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:33,920
That's right.
That's right.

10
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:36,023
- Thanks, buddy.
- What's the occasion?

11
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:37,959
Oh, I'm celebrating.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,162
My name's Jake Peralta,
and I just got fired from the NYPD.

13
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:45,951

14
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:06,387
All right, listen up.

15
00:01:06,388 --> 00:01:07,989
What you're about to see
is highly disturbing,

16
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:09,390
but please, no comments.

17
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:12,692
This man is in pain,
so above all else, be kind.

18
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:18,064
Good morning, Boyle.

19
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:19,700
Let's just get it out there.

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,468
Vivian broke up with me last night.

21
00:01:21,503 --> 00:01:24,605
I'm sorry, chucklebunny.

22
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:26,007
Charles, wait!

23
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:27,441
Yes?

24
00:01:27,442 --> 00:01:30,043
Your food dehydrator.

25
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:31,745
Oh, God.

26
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:33,114
It's official.

27
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:36,817
The wedding's off, and
this is what I'm like now.

28
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:38,718
- Life is a pit.
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

29
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:40,688
I don't understand.
Did you already have

30
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:42,990
a matrix getup at home for some reason?

31
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:45,091
No, Gina, I bought this with the money

32
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:47,728
I was going to spend on
our honeymoon to cape canaveral.

33
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:49,096
I'm so sorry, buddy.

34
00:01:49,097 --> 00:01:53,401
Don't be, I'm settling
into the darkness nicely.

35
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:56,103
I definitely get you now.

36
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:57,405
What you got there, Boyle?

37
00:01:57,406 --> 00:01:58,972
Eggs in a bag.

38
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:01,641
Nothing brings me
joy anymore, not even food.

39
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:03,243
Now, I only eat for sustenance.

40
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:08,582
Smart.
Save that for later.

41
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:10,183
Peralta?

42
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:14,555
My office, now.

43
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:16,157
Sir?

44
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:18,658
Commissioner Podolski.

45
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:20,461
It's been a while.
Maybe because you haven't

46
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:23,197
put any of my children
in handcuffs recently.

47
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:25,132
Yay, enemies for life.

48
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:27,013
Peralta, have you been
investigating Lucas Wint?

49
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:28,169
Yeah, I have.

50
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,971
I think he's laundering money
for drug dealers.

51
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:33,139
Don't be an idiot.
Lucas Wint is a civic leader.

52
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,942
He runs a major charity,

53
00:02:34,977 --> 00:02:38,012
his community center is the
lifeblood of that neighborhood,

54
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:41,848
and he officially claims
you have been harassing him.

55
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,585
What?
That's insane.

56
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:45,686
I've been trying to talk to him,

57
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:48,122
and he keeps avoiding me
like a guilty person,

58
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:52,058
so I approached him
at his weekly basketball game.

59
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,061
Hey there, Wint, I got
a couple questions for you.

60
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:55,263
I told you to back off.

61
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:56,831
This is completely inappropriate.

62
00:02:56,831 --> 00:03:00,467
No, this is me scoring in your face!

63
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:01,769
Kobe!

64
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,906
Seemed like an obvious goal-tend,
but that's besides the point.

65
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:07,741
Peralta, do you have any evidence
to support your suspicions?

66
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:09,843
There's a lot of chatter
amongst low-level drug dealers.

67
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:11,181
Chatter?
Sorry, I know.

68
00:03:11,347 --> 00:03:12,646
I hate that word too.

69
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:13,647
Tittle-tattle.

70
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:15,615
Just stay away from Wint.

71
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:17,151
That's an order.

72
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:20,086
Captain, I'm telling you
this is reliable tittle-tattle.

73
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,188
You have to trust me.

74
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:22,389
Trust me.

75
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,558
It's in your best interest to back off.

76
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:25,893
Fine.

77
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:27,627
But just for the record,
I think you're both wrong.

78
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:30,631
Self dismissed.

79
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:32,800
We have to help Charles.
He's devastated.

80
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,235
<i>I hate seeing him like this.</i>

81
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:36,871
Breakups are cartoony, thumbs down.

82
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:39,606
They make people feel
face-with-xs-for-the-eyes.

83
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:41,209
What does that even mean?

84
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:43,444
The english language cannot fully capture

85
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:45,346
the depth and complexity of my thoughts,

86
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:49,616
so I'm incorporating emoji into my
speech to better express myself.

87
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:51,218
Winky face.
Oh, lord.

88
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,652
Listen, this is simple.

89
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:54,989
Boyle needs a little rebound nooky.

90
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,524
Eggplant emoji.

91
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:58,025
Rosa, you wanna get on that?

92
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:00,026
Don't make me rip your tongue off.

93
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:02,430
I would talk to him, but
I don't think I have any advice.

94
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:04,731
All of my breakups
have been completely mutual.

95
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:07,735
This is the best possible
option for both of us.

96
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,205
Agreed.
Take care.

97
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:13,993
That was the end
of an eight-year relationship.

98
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,276
You know, I haven't had
that many romantic breakups,

99
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:18,512
but neither of my children
will speak to me anymore.

100
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:20,447
All right.
None of you are any help.

101
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:22,817
Sarge and I will cheer up Charles.

102
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,685
Oh.

103
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,586
He's not even chewing them anymore.

104
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:30,324
Listen to this text Boyle just sent me.

105
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:34,562
"I finally know what used napkins at
a barbecue restaurant feel like."

106
00:04:34,562 --> 00:04:36,430
I hate breakups.

107
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,935
I hope I never go through one again.

108
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:39,300
Really?

109
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,701
You think you'll spend the rest
of your life with Teddy?

110
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:42,903
What?
No.

111
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:44,572
Maybe.
I don't know.

112
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:46,740
Just saying getting dumped is a nightmare.

113
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:48,442
No arguments here.

114
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:49,944
I remember my worst breakup.

115
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:52,449
Eighth grade.
Jenny Gildenhorn.

116
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,247
Hey, Jenny.

117
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:56,483
Jake, I don't wanna go out anymore.

118
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:57,651
I like Eddie Fung now.

119
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:59,387
But it's my bar Mitzvah.

120
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:01,875
We were gonna grind.

121
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,091
That day, I truly became a man.

122
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:05,593
Wonder where Eddie Fung is now.

123
00:05:05,593 --> 00:05:07,261
867 Clinton street, apartment 2A.

124
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:09,197
I know exactly where that bastard is.

125
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:11,331
Get down, it's Wint!

126
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,233
Wha... Wint?
Holt told you to drop that.

127
00:05:13,235 --> 00:05:14,569
I thought we were working a burglary.

128
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:16,639
I know, I lied.
Apology? Apology accepted.

129
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,273
Look, Podolski is wrong.
Wint is guilty.

130
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:21,776
Yesterday, I saw him get into a
car with a known drug dealer.

131
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:24,312
I didn't have time to take a
picture, but today, I came prepared.

132
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:25,480
Did you tell Holt what you saw?

133
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,980
No, I don't trust him on this.

134
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:28,249
How can you not trust Holt?

135
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,483
He's the executor of my will.

136
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:31,151
Wint has crazy ties to city hall.

137
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:33,788
I just don't think Holt would
risk giving up his command.

138
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:35,423
Anyway.

139
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:37,524
Oh, crap.
Where'd he go?

140
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,995
Hello, Detective Peralta.

141
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:42,529
Amy.

142
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:44,365
Tell me who's there.

143
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:46,167
I'm blind.

144
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:49,437
You disobeyed my direct orders
to drop this case.

145
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:50,670
I staked out Wint 'cause I got a tip

146
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:52,173
he was meeting up with a drug dealer.

147
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:53,507
And why didn't you tell me about this?

148
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:55,343
Because you told me to drop the case.

149
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:58,012
Look, let's just agree to say "I'm
sorry" on the count of three.

150
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:00,882
One, two, three.

151
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,750
See? Now, I'm just
disappointed in both of us.

152
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,718
This is unacceptable,
and you've crossed the line.

153
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,920
Sir, I am Amy Santiago,
and I have something to say.

154
00:06:06,922 --> 00:06:08,790
I think you're wrong.

155
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,690
I think Detective Peralta
is onto something,

156
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:12,360
and you should let him pursue it.

157
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,228
I'm Amy Santiago, and I'm done talking.

158
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:16,798
Good, because this is none of your concern.

159
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:19,699
Commissioner Podolski is bringing
you up on charges and specs.

160
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:21,636
You're facing a six-month suspension,

161
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:23,504
and you're on administrative
leave until the hearing.

162
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:25,372
Now, get out of my office.

163
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:27,742
Fine.

164
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:29,310
Here's my gun and my badge.

165
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,545
I don't need those.
You're not suspended yet.

166
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:33,113
You're on administrative leave.

167
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:34,949
You never let me do anything cool.

168
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:39,716
Good morning, Captain.

169
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:42,619
I got you your favorite breakfast,
a plain bagel and a water.

170
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,721
Don't try to soften me up.

171
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:46,055
Why'd you ask me to meet you in this alley

172
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:47,524
in Bensonhurst at 9:00 in the morning?

173
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:49,225
Look, my best chance
of not getting suspended

174
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:50,661
is proving that Wint is guilty.

175
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,730
I got a confidential
informant I need you to meet.

176
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:55,531
You continue to work this case
against my direct orders?

177
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,201
You astound me.

178
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:58,268
Thank you, sir.

179
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:00,204
You astound me as well.

180
00:07:00,204 --> 00:07:02,271
But I didn't find him.

181
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:04,274
Santiago did.

182
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:06,642
What is going on with you?

183
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,045
I don't know, sir.

184
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:09,779
We're both off-roading it here.

185
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:12,449
My internal GPS has been
recalculating for a week.

186
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:13,850
This is Isaac.

187
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,653
He used to be a pusher
for the bay Ridge boys.

188
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:17,588
Dude, drugs don't need pushing.

189
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:19,889
They push themselves.
People love drugs.

190
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:21,225
Tell him about the donations.

191
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:23,093
All right, look, every friday, I put cash

192
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:25,562
into a duffel bag and bring it
to Wint community center,

193
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:27,564
room 265, and they mark it down

194
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:29,867
as a charitable donation
in their account book.

195
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,903
Ergo, laundering.

196
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:34,103
So why should we believe you?

197
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,072
I don't care who you believe.

198
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:36,305
Just know I hate those dudes now.

199
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:38,509
They carved up my territory so
bad, I had to quit selling drugs,

200
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:39,942
and I love selling drugs.

201
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:41,077
It was my dream job.

202
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:42,446
Sir, I filled out a warrant request

203
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:44,581
to search the community center
for the account book.

204
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:47,283
I need you to sign it
before I can take it to a judge.

205
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:51,588
I know I'm asking you to stick your
neck out, but please trust me.

206
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:52,990
Fine.

207
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,060
But I'll be with you every step of the way.

208
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,728
You know, you should just
put a microchip in his neck

209
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:58,728
like a little doggy.

210
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,029
All right, Isaac, thank you.

211
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:01,699
Yeah, you're done.

212
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:02,733
All right, guys.

213
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,468
We have Peralta's hearing at 4:00.

214
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:05,769
Anybody seen Boyle?

215
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,370
Present.

216
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,173
He seems even worse than before.

217
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:11,841
I lost Vivian, and now I might lose Jake.

218
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:12,875
I don't know what else to do.

219
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:14,110
I've tried being supportive.

220
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:18,214
I listened to him talk about
Vivian's lips for over two hours.

221
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:19,716
He kept describing them as "ample."

222
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,185
So ample.

223
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,187
Rosa.

224
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:27,423
Have you ever been dumped?

225
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:28,826
No.

226
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:30,427
In all my breakups, I'm always the dumper.

227
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:33,397
I know you're having a hard time,
but I think I can fix this.

228
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:37,433
There's this thing that I
do whenever I... Feel.

229
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:38,469
What?

230
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:43,374
Burn everything.

231
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:48,312
Okay.
This feels right.

232
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:50,246
No, it's terrible!
Vivian, I won't let you burn!

233
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,817
Ooh!

234
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,985
Oh, that's so hot!

235
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:58,253
What is that?
It's coffee.

236
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:01,392
Hot coffee?

237
00:09:01,393 --> 00:09:03,860
Look at us, three rogue cops

238
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:06,496
taking on a case the
commissioner told us to drop.

239
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,965
Button up your jacket.
Sit up straight.

240
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:10,668
Judge Mindel has a reputation
for being strict and proper.

241
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:11,668
All right, no worries.

242
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:13,102
I'll just act like you.

243
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:15,605
Say something so I can get
the cadence of your voice down.

244
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,206
I will not.
Perfect.

245
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:20,009
I will not.
I... Will not.

246
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,320
I will... Not.

247
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:25,822
Have a seat, Detective.

248
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,947
I will not.

249
00:09:27,114 --> 00:09:27,918
Excuse me?

250
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,352
Sorry.

251
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:32,355
I meant out of respect,
I will choose to stand.

252
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:35,259
Sit, I will not.

253
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:38,962
This looks like it
was filled out by a toddler.

254
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,165
Now, we're going to have to go
through this point by point.

255
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,534
Justice cannot be rushed.

256
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:47,870
But could it be
gently nudged into hyper speed?

257
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:49,539
I take it you're the toddler.

258
00:09:50,642 --> 00:09:53,309
Excuse me a moment.

259
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:56,779
This is going terribly.
New plan.

260
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,850
I'm gonna charm her.

261
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,150
Oh, no.

262
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:02,619
I'm sorry.
I had to take that.

263
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:05,089
You gotta do what you gotta do.

264
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:08,057
Captain Raymond Holt.

265
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:11,261
What's up?

266
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:16,042
You wanted to see me, sarge?

267
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,134
Yeah, come on in, Boyle.

268
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,135
Sorry to hear about your hand.

269
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:20,370
Thanks.

270
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:23,206
It makes it really hard
to manipulate my egg sack.

271
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,009
Look.
Here's the deal.

272
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:27,110
I did my Junior year abroad in Tokyo.

273
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:30,380
And my girlfriend Chiaki?
She broke my heart.

274
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:45,528
I stared at the paper walls for weeks

275
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,731
until my roommates showed me
how to vent my feelings.

276
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,005
Take a plate and smash it.

277
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:58,075
Oh!

278
00:10:58,076 --> 00:10:59,275
Feels good.
Yeah!

279
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:01,245
All right. Your turn, Boyle.
Okay.

280
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,645
Vent those feelings!
Okay.

281
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:05,282
Here we go, sarge.
Yeah.

282
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,753
Oh, my testicles!

283
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:11,754
We got a warrant.
But now, we need a plan.

284
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:13,524
We can't just go in there in our uniforms.

285
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:16,427
They'll destroy the evidence before
we even walk through the door.

286
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,227
Good point, Captain Holt,

287
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:21,731
or should I say
"Captain Raymond sex vibes"?

288
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,399
Who knew you had such game?

289
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:26,870
Yes, I've found that many women
want what they can't have.

290
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,871
I get it.
Ew.

291
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:31,029
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

292
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:33,376
According to the community center calendar,

293
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:35,283
amateur ballroom dancing competition.

294
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,148
Okay.

295
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:39,850
I know how we're gonna blend in.

296
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:43,586
- Don't say "thrift store."
- Thrift store!

297
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:52,263
♪ I... ♪

298
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:53,931

299
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:57,301

00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:59,102

♪ Thank you for let... ♪

302
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:06,277
Jake, the overwhelming time pressure.

303
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:07,410
Yep.

304
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:11,567
All right, Isaac said the account book

305
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,788
was in room 265.
It's gotta be upstairs.

306
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:15,303
Let's head up.

307
00:12:15,304 --> 00:12:17,005
Hey.
Where you goin'?

308
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,441
To the dance contest.

309
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:21,277
I am nationally-recognized
fox-trotter Dave Blathis,

310
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,182
and these are my proteges, Rhonda
Shawarma and Hank Frankel.

311
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:27,549
I don't care who you are.

312
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,184
Upstairs is closed to the public.

313
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:30,385
Fine.

314
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:34,823
But we didn't have to endure this
crap when we danced in Barcelona.

315
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:36,725
The hearing's starting any second.

316
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,827
There may be another
staircase off the dance floor.

317
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:39,995
I'll sign us up for the contest.

318
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:41,463
Good idea.
Oh, and Amy.

319
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:45,735
Your dress makes you look like a mermaid.

320
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:48,937
Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

321
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,773
I know we're all concerned about Boyle,

322
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:53,775
but again, there is a solution.

323
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:57,078
Forget your ex with meaningless sex.

324
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,584
It rhymes because it's true.

325
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,149
All right, everyone.

326
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:02,118
Peralta needs us to stall.

327
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:04,019
So just keep your answers long.

328
00:13:04,053 --> 00:13:06,889
Add stuff.
Embellish your asses off.

329
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:07,889
Boyle, you're first.

330
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,393
I don't know if I'm up for this.

331
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:13,129
I'm so emotional.
I can barely think straight.

332
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:15,063
Great.
Use that.

333
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:16,264
Embrace the void.

334
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,201
Would you say Detective Peralta

335
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:20,369
was overly interested in the Wint case?

336
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:23,806
I only heard Detective Peralta
talk about Lucas Wint once.

337
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:25,106
<i>We were in my car.</i>

338
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:28,711
I took Vivian on our first
real date in that car.

339
00:13:28,745 --> 00:13:30,950
Vivian is my fiancee.

340
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:34,383
My ex-fiancee.

341
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:35,884
My never-wife.

342
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:37,986
Detective Boyle, if you could,

343
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:40,056
please limit your comments
to the matter at hand.

344
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:41,190
I will.

345
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:42,892
I'd just like the record to reflect

346
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:48,463
that "matter at hand" was one of
Vivian's favorite expressions.

347
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:49,599
We should try to blend in.

348
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,133
Stretch your leg up over your head.

349
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:53,836
What? You stretch
your leg up over your head.

350
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,203
You think I wouldn't if I could?

351
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:59,307
Ooh, looks like
the Captain found a partner.

352
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:00,643
<i>Good lord.</i>

353
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:06,638
Okay, we begin with a free-dance
period to the spicy sounds of rumba.

354
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:11,220
All right.
The linoleum awaits, my dear.

355
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:12,654
Oh, boy.

356
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:14,222
I know we're undercover,
but I'm starting to get

357
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:15,857
real nervous about this contest.

358
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:17,426
You need to see a therapist.

359
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,061
Yeah.
Let's dance this way.

360
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:20,996
Okay.
Ho, hoo.

361
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,799
How did you manage to step on
both of my feet at the same time?

362
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,934
I'm horrible at this.
When can we stop?

363
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:27,673
I'm horrible at this...
I know, I know.

364
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:29,639
Title of my sex tape.

365
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:30,873
<i>Well done.</i>

366
00:14:30,874 --> 00:14:32,808
Title of my sex tape.

367
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:34,610
Oh, my God, the Captain.

368
00:14:34,644 --> 00:14:37,013
He could really win this thing.

369
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:38,748
How did you get so amazing at dancing?

370
00:14:38,782 --> 00:14:40,182
Jake, focus.

371
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,817
I found a back stairway over here.

372
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:43,885
And spin.

373
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:45,754
Who is he?

374
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:47,956
As far as I can recall, Detective Peralta

375
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:52,595
told me that...

376
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:55,576
That...

377
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,099
He...

378
00:14:57,134 --> 00:14:59,969
No, I never heard Jake talk about Wint.

379
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:01,937
And the very fact
that you have him on trial

380
00:15:01,938 --> 00:15:03,792
is cat-doing-<i>home-alone</i> -face.

381
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,168
Of...

382
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:06,875
Look, I've known Jake forever.

383
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:09,745
Our friendship is little-boy-
holding-little-girl's-hand.

384
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:15,684
God, that guard by the door will not move.

385
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:17,820
Oh, he just made eye contact with me.

386
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:19,588
Play it cool.
Dance.

387
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,623
Dance, dance, dance.

388
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,791
You don't have to say "dance"

389
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,759
every time you make a step.

390
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,994
Good call.
Hey.

391
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:27,196
Do you want me to actually
show you how to do this

392
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:29,692
so you don't hurt yourself
and possibly others?

393
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,698
Yes.
Okay.

394
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:31,768
Ready?

395
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:38,540
This is kinda fun.

396
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,308
Yeah.

397
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,078
Maybe Teddy and I should take a class.

398
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,381
Yeah.
Maybe.

399
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:47,549
Guys, we're running out of time.

400
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:49,719
What's the plan?
That guard won't move.

401
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,952
We need a distraction.

402
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:51,952
I'm on it.

403
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:54,123
Dance, dance, dance, dance.

404
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:55,857
Oh, God!
Oh!

405
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:57,927
My ankle!
Sir, my ankle!

406
00:15:57,927 --> 00:15:59,761
Oh, I heard a pop!
I heard a pop!

407
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:01,297
<i>Is that bad?
Do you know if that's bad?</i>

408
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:04,100
Oh, God!
Oh, I live to dance!

409
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:11,506
<i>Voila.</i>

410
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:14,210
So glad no one heard me say that.

411
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:16,178
Gotcha.

412
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:17,980
Aw, this is incredible.

413
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,448
The account books have everything.

414
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,183
Dates, names, dollar amounts.

415
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:23,385
I can't wait to show this to Podolski.

416
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:26,721
I should probably slip in a
Miley-Cyrus-told-you-so face real quick.

417
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:28,323
It's hard to do on the move.

418
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:30,025
Peralta, wait.

419
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:32,427
Santiago, give us a minute.

420
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:33,428
Sir?

421
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:34,496
I need you to do something.

422
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:36,665
And it's gonna sound
crazy, but it's important,

423
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,836
and I need you to trust me.

424
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,770
So Detective Peralta...

425
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:45,019
Do you have any evidence you'd
like to present on your behalf?

426
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:47,342
No.

427
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:49,378
I have nothing.

428
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,361
Jake.
What happened?

429
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:55,996
Did Holt ask you to get suspended?

430
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:57,764
No, he told me to get fired.

431
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:58,899
Why?
I don't know.

432
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:00,100
I'm kind of freaking out.

433
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,836
He said to do it, and the next
thing I knew, I was just yelling.

434
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:05,940
And<i> your</i> mother!
All of your mothers.

435
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,441
And your grandmothers.

436
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:10,044
And your grandmothers' little dogs.

437
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:11,444
Are you done?
No, I'm not done!

438
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:13,954
Aw, you're done!
You can't handle the me!

439
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:15,348
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Peralta!</i>

440
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:17,151
Hey.
What's goin' on?

441
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:19,119
This is special agent Clarke with the FBI.

442
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,788
FBI?
We couldn't let you expose Lucas Wint.

443
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:24,991
It would've compromised a much larger
ongoing federal investigation.

444
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,961
We believe that Wint has ties
to the Ianucci crime family.

445
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:29,630
That's one of the best crime families.

446
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,298
We needed you to get fired for real

447
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:33,934
because the Ianuccis
have moles inside the NYPD,

448
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,435
and we need them to trust you.

449
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:37,003
Detective, we'd like you to go undercover

450
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:38,439
and help us with the investigation.

451
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,707
Okay, the answer is "yes."

452
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,209
The details are:
My name is Duncan buck.

453
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,346
I was raised on a oil rig
by 90 men and 1 prostitute.

454
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,614
We'd like you to be yourself.

455
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,950
Even better.
This could be very dangerous.

456
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:51,586
- So please, take some time, and...
- No need. I'm in.

457
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:53,386
Eyes closed, head first, can't lose.

458
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:54,989
I don't think that's the expression.

459
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,082
Can you just let me have this?

460
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:00,795
What I'm about to tell you
cannot leave this room.

461
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:01,962
Detective Peralta will be going

462
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:03,864
in an undercover assignment with the FBI.

463
00:18:03,898 --> 00:18:05,499
His cover story is that he was fired.

464
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,335
Oh, my God.
My heart just threw up.

465
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:08,736
Look, they're saying
this assignment will last

466
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,738
about six months, so while I'm gone,

467
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,873
Boyle, I want you to have my desk.

468
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:14,375
I'll sit at it always.

469
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:16,351
Rosa, you can have my locker.

470
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:17,211
Sweet.

471
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:19,547
Amy, you can have all of my open cases.

472
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:20,647
<i>Okay, that's enough.</i>

473
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:23,317
Peralta doesn't have the
authority to do any of this.

474
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:26,988
You will all sit at your own desk
and work the cases I assign you.

475
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:30,625
But you will be missed.

476
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,659
Thank you, Captain.

477
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:35,695
Thank you for trusting me.

478
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,298
Okay, now call us all names

479
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:39,232
and storm out of here
for the benefit of the bullpen.

480
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,001
This is the best day ever.

481
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:44,605
I'll miss you guys.

482
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:46,339
And your mother!

483
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,108
And<i> your</i> mother.

484
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:50,377
<i>You're all a bunch of pigs!</i>

485
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:53,647
I smell bacon!

486
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:55,782
And guess what else, "Captain"?

487
00:18:55,817 --> 00:19:00,621
You can take this tie and shove
it straight into your hellhole!

488
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:03,723
This whole place reeks of bacon.

489
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:04,991
And guess what?

490
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:09,763
I'm going kosher 'cause
Jake-y don't dig on swine!

491
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:10,778
Whoo!

492
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:13,099
All right, everyone.
I wanna make a toast.

493
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,169
To you guys.

494
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,071
You will never be Jake or Vivian,
but at least you're here.

495
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,174
I'm gonna go over by the
bar where I can hear you worse.

496
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:23,510
Oh, I get it.
I'd abandon me too.

497
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:25,346
That's it.
Boyle, no more eggs.

498
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:27,048
You are drinking your troubles away.

499
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:28,249
Start with this.

500
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,717
I'm gonna get some bottles from the bar.

501
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,619
Make way! Large man
helping his little friend.

502
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:35,388
Comin' through!

503
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,924
You're so lucky you've never
been through a painful breakup.

504
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:39,026
The only reason they haven't been painful

505
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:42,063
is 'cause the guys were all losers.

506
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:43,396
I've never dated anyone good.

507
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,001
Like you.

508
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:54,608
Amy?

509
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:55,942
Hey, thought I missed you.

510
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:58,311
Hey, Jake.
Amazing assignment.

511
00:19:58,346 --> 00:20:01,015
I have to admit I'm a little jealous.

512
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:02,517
Really?

513
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:03,884
Well, if you want,
I could help you get fired.

514
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:05,786
I'm really good at it.

515
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,087
Yeah.

516
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,022
This is real.
This is happening.

517
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,025
Look...

518
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:12,559
I don't wanna be a jerk.

519
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,730
I know you're dating Teddy,
and it's going really well.

520
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:19,265
It's just...
What's going on?

521
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,303
I don't know what's gonna
happen on this assignment.

522
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,105
And if something bad goes down,
I think I'd be pissed at myself

523
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:27,040
if I didn't say this.

524
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:34,208
I kinda wish something could happen
between us, romantic-styles.

525
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:36,584
And I know it can't
'cause you're with Teddy,

526
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:40,922
and I'm going undercover,
and that's just how it is.

527
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:45,692
But...

528
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:49,663
Anyway, we're not supposed to
have any contact, so I should go.

529
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:51,265
America needs me.

530
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,300
Bye.

531
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:58,471
And another round for everyone on me!

532
00:20:58,472 --> 00:20:59,773
Thanks, buddy.

533
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,775
What's the occasion?

534
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:02,643
Oh, I'm celebrating.

535
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:08,782
My name's Jake Peralta,
and I just got fired from the NYPD.

536
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:12,752
I'm Leo...
Ianucci.

537
00:21:12,753 --> 00:21:15,957
Nice to meet you.

538
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:34,541
